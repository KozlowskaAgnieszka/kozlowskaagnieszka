### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

### After many years of working in Digital Marketing, Iâ€™ve decided to switch my career and pursue my old passion - programming. My goal is to succeed as a FrontEnd Developer and to achieve it, Iâ€™ve started intensive learning - Iâ€™ve completed postgraduate studies, took part in a number of trainings in both programming and testing, and I continue to expand my knowledge on my own ğŸ”­.

### It's just a beggining of my journey... ğŸ˜„
